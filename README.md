Assignment 2: Roller Madness Project

In this assignment, you will complete the Roller Madness Unity3D project, which will
demonstrate your understanding of using standard assets, creating prefabs, using physics,
creating a complex game system through the use of pre-created scripts, creating basic user
interface elements, creating basic particle systems, creating basic keyframe animations, building
the project, and packaging the project for sharing with the peer review system.

Review criteria

Instructions:
1. Follow along with the lecture slides that accompany the course to build the basis of your
game.
2. Duplicate the “Level1” scene to create a “Level2” scene. (Edit->Duplicate)
3. Modify Level2 to create an interesting second level of the game through the use of
bumpers, floor pieces, other prototype assets, enemies, coins, and spawners. Try to make
your level coherent. That is, try to make a complete experience for your player vs. a
bunch of random things thrown together.
4. In Level 2, modify the GameOverCanvas to have the “Play Again” button to load
“Level2” when pressed.
5. In Level 2, modify the GameOverCanvas by adding a second “Restart” button that loads
“Level1” when pressed.
6. In Level1, create a BeatLevel UI Canvas, “Level Victory” message, and “Next Level”
button, that when pressed, loads “Level2”.
7. In Level1, modify the GameManager to allow you to beat the level by collecting 5 coins
and bring up the BeatLevel UI Canvas, so players are congratulated and then can move
on to Level2. Don’t make it too hard to move from Level1 to Level2. Feel free to make
Level2 either more difficult to beat or have no victory state.
8. Make sure all the scenes that you use are included in the Build Settings (File->Build
Settings...)
9. Play your game several times and make sure there are no bugs (code issues), flaws in
gameplay, or look-and-feel issues. If there are, fix them.
10. Create a compressed (zip archive) of your project folder.
11. Upload the resulting zip archive for peer review
